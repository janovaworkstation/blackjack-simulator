## Architecture Overview

The project follows a strategy-driven architecture that transforms simulation data into actionable live play guidance through an intelligent AI dealer coach. The system creates a unified ecosystem where profitable strategies discovered through simulation directly guide and evaluate live play performance.

### Current Priority: Strategy-Driven Architecture Implementation ðŸŽ¯

**NEW PRIORITY #1: Strategy Foundation System**
- **Strategy Definition**: TypeScript interfaces for strategy data model with simulation config + betting strategy + AI coaching preferences
- **Strategy Management**: localStorage persistence with CRUD operations via `useStrategyManager` hook
- **Strategy Validation**: Profitability verification and comparison systems

**NEW PRIORITY #2: AI Dealer Coach System** 
- **AICoach Class**: Intelligent coaching engine with multiple personalities (mentor, expert, instructor)
- **Coaching Modes**: Card-by-card, end-of-shoe, count critique, and strategy adherence coaching
- **3D Avatar Integration**: Realistic dealer character with contextual dialogue and visual feedback

**NEW PRIORITY #3: Live Play Integration**
- **Strategy-Guided Gameplay**: Real-time decision recommendations based on saved strategies
- **Performance Analytics**: Strategy adherence tracking and improvement measurement
- **Adaptive Learning**: AI coach adjusts intensity based on player skill progression

### Existing Foundation - IMPLEMENTED âœ…
- **`BlackjackSimulator.tsx`** - Main simulation application (to be enhanced with strategy management)
- **`BlackjackEngine.ts`** - Core simulation engine (to be extended with strategy creation workflow)
- **`useSimulation.ts`** - Simulation state management (to be enhanced with strategy saving)
- **Interactive Game Components** - Full 3D blackjack game (to be integrated with AI coaching)

### 3D Gaming Platform Components - NEW âœ…
- **`BlackjackTable3D.tsx`** - Immersive 3D blackjack table with realistic casino atmosphere
- **`Card3D.tsx`** - 3D playing card component with face-up/down states and suit-based styling
- **`Chip3D.tsx`** - Casino-style poker chips with value-based colors and realistic geometry
- **`Game3DDemo.tsx`** - Demo page showcasing the 3D gaming experience

### Strategy-Driven Data Flow
1. **Strategy Creation**: `ConfigurationPanel` â†’ `BlackjackSimulator` â†’ `useSimulation` â†’ `BlackjackEngine` â†’ Strategy Results
2. **Strategy Management**: Strategy Results â†’ Strategy Validation â†’ `useStrategyManager` â†’ localStorage persistence
3. **AI Coaching Integration**: Saved Strategy â†’ `AICoach` class â†’ Live play decision analysis and feedback
4. **Performance Tracking**: Player Actions â†’ Strategy Comparison â†’ Performance Analytics â†’ Progress Reports

### Core Philosophy Implementation
The data flow transforms from linear simulation â†’ results to cyclical strategy creation â†’ coaching â†’ improvement:
- Simulation creates profitable strategies
- Strategies are validated and saved with metadata
- AI coach uses strategies as benchmarks for live play evaluation
- Performance data feeds back to strategy refinement and coaching adaptation

### Key Implementation Plan

**Card Counting Systems:**
- To be implemented in a `COUNTING_SYSTEMS` object in `BlackjackEngine.js`.
- Initial systems for the MVP will include Hi-Lo and KO (Knock-Out), as per `TASKS.md`.
- The design will be extensible to support additional systems in the future.

**Basic Strategy:**
- Strategy logic will be implemented using decision matrices (e.g., `BASIC_STRATEGY`, `SOFT_STRATEGY`, `PAIR_STRATEGY`).
- The engine will make decisions based on the player's hand, the dealer's up-card, and game rules.

**Simulation Engine:**
- Will feature a multi-deck shoe with configurable penetration and realistic shuffling.
- Will support count-based betting spreads.
- Will handle all standard player actions: split, double, and surrender.

### UI Structure - IMPLEMENTED âœ…
- **Dual Interface Design**: Navigation between Analysis (Simulator) and Gaming (3D Demo) modes
- **Responsive Layout**: Built with Tailwind CSS, works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Analysis Mode**: Configuration panel with results/charting area using Recharts for data visualization
- **3D Gaming Mode**: Immersive casino table with Three.js/React Three Fiber rendering
- **Interactive Navigation**: Seamless switching between simulation and 3D gaming experiences
