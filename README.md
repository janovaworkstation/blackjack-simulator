- **Realistic Game Rules**: Configurable deck count, penetration, dealer rules
- **Advanced Betting**: Count-based bet sizing with configurable spreads
- **Pair Splitting & Doubling**: Full implementation of all strategic plays

### Analysis & Reporting
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Win rates, expected value, standard deviation
- **Risk Analysis**: Maximum drawdown, risk ratings, hourly expectations
- **Performance Visualization**: Real-time charts showing bankroll progression
- **Session Tracking**: Hand-by-hand analysis with count correlation

### Modern Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress tracking during simulations
- **Interactive Configuration**: Easy-to-use parameter adjustment
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser to** `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Basic Simulation
1. Configure your simulation parameters:
   - Number of hands (1,000 - 10,000,000)
   - Counting system (Hi-Lo, KO, Hi-Opt I)
   - Deck count and penetration
   - Betting limits and spreads

2. Set game rules:
   - Dealer hits soft 17
   - Double after split
   - Surrender options
   - Re-split aces

3. Click "Run Simulation" and analyze results

### Understanding Results

#### Key Metrics
- **Expected Value (EV)**: Percentage return on total money wagered
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of hands won (not including pushes)
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest loss from peak bankroll
- **Risk Rating**: Low/Medium/High based on volatility

#### Performance Chart
- **Blue Line**: Bankroll progression over time
- **Red Line**: True count variations during session
