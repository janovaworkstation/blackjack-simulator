# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# <body>
#
# <footer>

# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat (new feature)
# * fix (bug fix)
# * docs (documentation)
# * style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# * refactor (refactoring production code)
# * test (adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change)
# * chore (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change)
#
# Scope is just the scope of the change. Something like (admin) or (teacher).
#
# Subject should use imperative tone and say what you did.
# The body should go into detail about changes made.
# The footer should contain any JIRA (or other tool) issue references or actions.

# Remember to:
# * Capitalize the subject line
# * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# * Do not end the subject line with a period
# * Separate subject from body with a blank line
# * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
# * Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
