# Blackjack Simulator

The `BlackjackSimulator` is the main component of the application. It orchestrates the entire simulation process, from configuration to displaying the results.

This component integrates several other components to provide a complete user experience:

- `ConfigurationPanel`: Allows users to set up the simulation parameters.
- `BettingTable`: Enables users to define a custom betting strategy.
- `ResultsPanel`: Displays the results of the simulation.
- `HandDetailsTable`: Shows a detailed log of each hand played.

## How it Works

The `BlackjackSimulator` component manages the state for the simulation configuration and results. When the "Run Simulation" button is clicked, it calls the `useSimulation` hook, which runs the simulation in a web worker to avoid blocking the UI.

The component passes down the necessary state and callbacks to its child components, ensuring that the entire UI is synchronized.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Charting:** Add real-time charting of the player's bankroll as the simulation progresses.
- **Strategy Deviations:** Allow users to input strategy deviations for specific hands.
- **More Counting Systems:** Add support for more card counting systems.
