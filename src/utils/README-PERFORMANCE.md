# Blackjack Simulator Performance Optimizations

## Current Optimizations

### 1. Throttled Progress Updates
- **Problem**: Progress callbacks every 1000 hands caused excessive React re-renders
- **Solution**: Throttle UI updates to maximum 100ms intervals using `Date.now()` checks
- **Impact**: Reduces UI update frequency while maintaining responsive progress feedback

### 2. Optimized Thread Yielding  
- **Problem**: Original yielding every 1000 hands could block UI for larger simulations
- **Solution**: Separate progress callbacks (1000 hands) from thread yielding (5000 hands)
- **Impact**: Better UI responsiveness during long simulations while maintaining progress accuracy

### 3. Web Worker Foundation
- **Status**: Infrastructure created but not fully implemented
- **Files**: `useWebWorkerSimulation.ts` hook and `public/blackjack-worker.js` worker
- **Next Steps**: Would require refactoring BlackjackEngine to be worker-compatible

## Performance Characteristics

### Before Optimizations
- Progress updates: Every 1000 hands (up to 100 UI updates for 100k simulation)  
- Thread yielding: Every 1000 hands
- UI responsiveness: Could freeze for 1-2 seconds between yields

### After Optimizations
- Progress updates: Maximum every 100ms (10 updates per second max)
- Thread yielding: Every 5000 hands (fewer interruptions, longer compute chunks)
- UI responsiveness: Smooth progress updates, less frequent but still responsive yielding

## Implementation Details

### Progress Throttling
```typescript
let lastProgressUpdate = 0;
const progressCallback = (current: number, total: number) => {
  const now = Date.now();
  // Update progress at most every 100ms or on completion
  if (now - lastProgressUpdate >= 100 || current === total) {
    setProgress({ current, total });
    lastProgressUpdate = now;
  }
};
```

### Optimized Yielding
```typescript
// Progress callback every 1000 hands
if (progressCallback && (i + 1) % 1000 === 0) {
  progressCallback(i + 1, totalSimulations);
}

// Yield to main thread every 5000 hands for better performance
if ((i + 1) % 5000 === 0) {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
}
```

## Web Worker Implementation (Future)

To fully implement Web Worker support:

1. **Extract BlackjackEngine**: Make it dependency-free for worker environment
2. **Message Protocol**: Implement progress/results message passing
3. **Error Handling**: Robust fallback to main thread on worker failures
4. **Testing**: Ensure identical results between worker and main thread

The infrastructure is in place but would require significant refactoring to be fully functional.

## Recommendations

1. **Current Implementation**: Good balance of performance and complexity
2. **For Future**: Consider Web Worker for simulations > 50k hands
3. **Alternative**: Could use `requestIdleCallback` for even smoother UI integration
4. **Monitoring**: Consider adding performance metrics to track actual improvements
